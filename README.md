You're absolutely right to clarify this! If you exclude the `android` and `ios` folders from your template, users **won’t automatically know it’s a prebuild project**—they might assume it’s a managed Expo project. Here’s how to handle this properly:

---

### **Solution 1: Explicitly Document It (Best for Templates)**
#### **1. Remove `android`/`ios` Folders**  
Delete them from your template (keep them in `.gitignore` to avoid accidental commits).  

#### **2. Add Clear Instructions in `README.md`**  
```markdown
# 🚀 Expo + NativeWind + Router (Prebuild Template)

⚠️ **This is a prebuild-enabled project.** The `android` and `ios` folders are intentionally excluded.  
Run the command below to generate them with your current Expo SDK:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

### Why?  
- Ensures native code matches your local Expo SDK version.  
- Avoids conflicts from outdated native files.  

### First-Time Setup  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Generate native code:  
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```
4. Start the app:  
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
```

---

### **Solution 2: Keep a "Stub" Folder (For Clarity)**  
Create empty `android`/`ios` folders with a `README.md` inside:  
```
my-template/
├── android/
│   └── README.md  ← "Run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code"
├── ios/
│   └── README.md  ← Same as above
└── ...
```

**Contents of `README.md`:**  
```markdown
# Native Code Directory  
This folder will be auto-generated by Expo Prebuild.  

Run:  
```bash
npx expo prebuild
```
```

---

### **Key Points to Communicate**  
1. **Prebuild is Required**: Users must run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code.  
2. **Why It’s Excluded**:  
   - Avoids version conflicts (native code is SDK-specific).  
   - Reduces template size.  
3. **Plugins Handle Everything**:  
   - `app.json` plugins (e.g., `expo-router`, `expo-splash-screen`) will auto-configure the native code during `prebuild`.

---

### **When to Use Each Approach**  
| Approach | Best For |  
|----------|----------|  
| **Documentation-Only** | Tech-savvy users who read READMEs. |  
| **Stub Folders** | Beginners who need visual cues. |  

For your setup (Expo Router + NativeWind), **Solution 1 (clear docs)** is sufficient—most Expo users are familiar with `prebuild`.

---

### **Example `app.json` for Clarity**  
Ensure plugins are listed so users know native code will be customized:  
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-router",
      "expo-font",
      "expo-splash-screen"
    ]
  }
}
```

This way, even without folders, users understand native code is **intentionally dynamic**.
